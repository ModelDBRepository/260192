This is the readme for the model associated with the paper:

Ellen K.W. Brennan, Shyam Kumar Sudhakar, Izabela Jedrasiak-Cape, Tibin T. John & Omar J. Ahmed, Hyperexcitable neurons enable precise and persistent information encoding in the superficial retrosplenial cortex, Cell Reports in press


File descriptions
-------------------

LR_neuron_tuned.hoc - Neuron template of Low Rheobase (LR) neuron described in the paper
RS_neuron_tuned.hoc - Neuron template of Regular spiking (RS) neuron described in the paper
test_model_RS.hoc - Test file to run the RS neuron model
test_model_LR.hoc - Test file to run the LR neuron model


How the run the model
--------------------

Download all files to your computer and cd to the corresponding folder
On the terminal, type "mknrndll (or nrnivmodl)" to complile the .mod files 

Type "nrngui test_model_RS.hoc" or " nrngui test_model_LR.hoc" to run 
the model


test_model_RS.hoc - creates figure 6B of the paper (low current)
test_model_LR.hoc - creates figure 6F of the paper (low current)

For generating the FI curves (Figure 6D and 6H), please use current 
current clamp (already inserted in the template files) with a delay of 
500 ms and duration of 1000 ms.

For accurate results, use a dt of 0.025 ms.
